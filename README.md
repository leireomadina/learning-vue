Hi! üëã

This is a compendium of all the exercises I developed during the **Udemy** course [**Vue - The Complete Guide** (w/ Router, Vuex, Composition API)](https://www.udemy.com/course/vuejs-2-the-complete-guide/) by **Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller**.

## 2. Overview

### Motivation

During the Adalab bootcamp I learned basic React concepts and developed a few apps with this framework. Even though I really enjoyed working with it, the more I read about Vue the more it caught my attention: having the HTML, CSS and JS code organized and separated in the same file, the use of templates, the progressive framework concept and so on.

So I really wanted to learn and practice the core concepts of this framework by doing several exercises and apps with this Udemy course which, btw, I highly recommend.

### How to run the project

From section-1 to section-7, several exercises were developed using the [Vue **CDN package**](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/installation.html#cdn), so there's no need to install anything: just clone this repository in your computer. üòÑ

However, from section-8 onwards, different Vue small apps were bootstrapped with [**Vue CLI**](https://cli.vuejs.org/). In order to work thim them, follow the next steps:

1. Make sure you have [**Node.js**](https://nodejs.org/es/) installed in your computer.
2. Open a specific folder and install **NPM packages and dependencies** with this  command in your terminal: 
  ```
  npm install
  ```
3. **Start running** the project and its live version in your browser with:
```
  npm run serve
  ```
5. You can now make whatever changes you want! üòé
